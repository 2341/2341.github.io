You can get around age restriction on youtube by opening the link intended for embeding. Just exchange `/watch?v=` with `/embed/` in the url. This only works if the creator of the video allowed embedding. This is the case for most videos.
For Firefox I wrote a extension that does exactly this. You can install it here [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ageless/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ageless/) or take a look at the source code here [https://github.com/2341/ageless](https://github.com/2341/ageless).
